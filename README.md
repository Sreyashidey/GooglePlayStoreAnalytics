## Project Title: Real-Time Google Play Store Data Analytics

## Introduction
I have worked on on real-time analytics for Google Play Store data using Python as a part of this project. The tasks involved data visualization, analysis, and dashboard implementation within a restricted timeframe.

## Background
The work focused on extracting, processing, and visualizing Google Play Store data to derive meaningful insights. The tasks were implemented within the existing framework of a completed website project.

## Learning Objectives
- Gain hands-on experience in data analytics using Python.
- Develop proficiency in data visualization using Plotly, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Work with real-world datasets to identify trends and insights.
- Implement time-restricted visualization features in a dashboard.

## Activities and Tasks
### Task 1: Scatter Plot - Revenue vs. Installs
- **Objective:** Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between revenue and the number of installs for paid apps only.
- **Implementation:**
  - Filtered dataset for paid apps.
  - Created scatter plot with color-coded categories.
  - Added a trendline to show correlation.

### Task 2: Grouped Bar Chart - Average Rating & Total Reviews
- **Objective:** Compare the average rating and total review count for the top 10 app categories.
- **Implementation:**
  - Filtered data for categories with an average rating above 4.0, app size above 10M, and last updated in January.
  - Implemented a grouped bar chart to compare rating and review count.
  - Integrated time-based visibility restriction (3 PM - 5 PM IST).

### Task 3: Heatmap - Correlation Matrix
- **Objective:** Generate a heatmap to show the correlation between installs, ratings, and review counts.
- **Implementation:**
  - Filtered apps  with a minimum of 100,000 installs and 1,000 reviews.
  - Excluded genres starting with A, F, E, G, I, K.
  - Implemented time-based visibility restriction (2 PM - 4 PM IST).

Apart from this all 10 figures from training sesssions have been implemented.

## Skills and Competencies
- Data Cleaning and Processing
- Data Visualization (Plotly, Matplotlib)
- Dashboard Development
- Python Scripting
- Html and css designs
- Time-based Conditional Rendering
- GitHub Repository Management

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Time-based Rendering:** Implemented JavaScript and Python logic to hide/show graphs based on IST.
- **Filtering Complex Data Conditions:** Applied advanced filtering techniques to meet strict conditions.

## Outcomes and Impact
- Successfully implemented all assigned tasks within the existing project framework.
- Developed a deeper understanding of real-time data analytics.
- Gained experience in implementing business logic using Python and JavaScript.

## Submission Requirements
- **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/Sreyashidey/GooglePlayStoreAnalytics
- **Hosted Website:** https://googleplaystoreanalytics.netlify.app/
- **.py Files Submission:** Uploaded Python scripts to GitHub.
- **Internship Report Submission:** Attached

## Conclusion
This provided valuable hands-on experience in real-world data analytics, visualization techniques, and dashboard development. The tasks challenged my ability to work independently, research effectively, and implement solutions efficiently.
